# Prework - IOS App Demo

Submitted by: **Hayden Howell**

**IOS App Demo** is an app that uses three labels and a button. The labels are <code>Hayden Howell</code>, <code>Oregon State University</code>, and <code>Software Engineer</code>. The button, titled <code>change</code>, is an interactive button that, when pressed, changes the background color. 

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ ] Users will see a screen with three labels and a button
- [ ] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes

The main challenge I faced when making this app was adding the video walkthrough to the README properly. But, after reading a few articles and watching the video provided by Codepath, I got it to work.
